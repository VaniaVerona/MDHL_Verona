            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>To support young athletes living in Chicago's northside neighborhoods, who have an interest in learning
                and playing hockey, with opportunities to learn and practice skills related to the game of hockey,
                specifically those skills around team cooperation and good sportsmanship.</p>

            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>The Mighty Ducks Hockey League aspires to develop strong, well-rounded, and mindful athletes through the
                building of character, self-discipline, and leadership.</p>

            <h3>General Information</h3>
            <p>The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in Chicago's
                northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play hockey. To be a member of MDHL, you
                must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. MDHL is run by a
                small full-time staff and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and previous league members.
